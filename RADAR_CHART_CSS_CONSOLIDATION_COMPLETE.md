# Radar Chart CSS Consolidation Complete

## Summary of Changes
This document summarizes the completion of the radar chart CSS consolidation task.

### Task Completed
- ✅ Merged `consolidated-comparison.css` file contents into `ProgressTracking.css`
- ✅ Removed the import statement for `consolidated-comparison.css` from `ProgressTracking.js`

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/daoming/Documents/Github/goAIME/frontend/src/components/ProgressTracking.css`
   - Added all styles from `consolidated-comparison.css` to the end of this file
   - Added a clear section header comment: `/* ===== CONSOLIDATED COMPARISON STYLES ===== */`
   - Modified radar chart section styles to use the optimized values:
     - Updated padding-left from 40px to 20px
     - Updated margin-left from 35px to 15px
     - Updated transform from translateX(35px) to translateX(15px)

2. `/Users/daoming/Documents/Github/goAIME/frontend/src/components/ProgressTracking.js`
   - Removed the import statement: `import './consolidated-comparison.css';`

### Benefits of the Change
1. **Simplified Codebase**: Reduced the number of CSS files by consolidating related styles
2. **Easier Maintenance**: All styles related to the Progress Tracking component are now in a single file
3. **Reduced HTTP Requests**: One less CSS file to load, potentially improving performance
4. **Optimized Positioning**: Radar chart is now correctly positioned, not overlapping with left boxes

### Next Steps
- The `consolidated-comparison.css` file can now be removed from the codebase (if desired)
- Run comprehensive tests across different browsers to verify visual consistency
- Document the new CSS structure for future reference

### Testing
- Visual verification tests have been run and passed
- Browser compatibility tests have been generated for manual verification
