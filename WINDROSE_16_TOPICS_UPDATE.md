# Wind Rose Chart Enhancement: 16 Topics Update

## Overview

This update improves the wind rose chart visualization by increasing the number of displayed topics from 8 to 16, providing users with a more comprehensive view of their topic performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Topic Count

Modified the wind rose chart to display the top 16 most attempted topics instead of just 8:

```javascript
// Get top 16 topics by attempt count (for cleaner visualization)
const topTopics = Object.entries(progressData.topicPerformance)
  .sort((a, b) => b[1].attempted - a[1].attempted)
  .slice(0, 16);
```

### 2. Improved Label Layout

Enhanced the label positioning to prevent overlaps with 16 topics:

```javascript
// For 16 topics, we need to place labels at different radiuses to avoid overlap
// Calculate dynamic label radius based on position in the circle
// This creates a spiral-like effect where some labels are closer to center and others further out
const baseRadius = 240 * 0.6; // 60% of max radius as base
const radiusVariation = 240 * 0.2; // 20% variation
const labelRadius = baseRadius + radiusVariation * (index % 4) / 4; // Vary radius by position
```

### 3. Optimized Label Size and Text

Reduced the label size and truncated longer topic names to ensure they fit properly:

```javascript
// Smaller label size
<rect
  x={x - 35}
  y={y - 10}
  width="70"
  height="20"
  rx="10"
  ry="10"
  ...
/>

// Truncate long topic names
<text ... >
  {topic[0].length > 12 ? `${topic[0].substring(0, 10)}...` : topic[0]}
</text>
```

### 4. Updated Chart Title and Description

Changed the title and center text to reflect the increased topic count:

- Changed section title to "Top 16 Topics Performance"
- Updated center text to "Top 16"
- Added descriptive note in the legend section

### 5. Added Verification Script

Created a browser console script (`verify_16_topics_windrose.js`) to verify the chart is displaying the expected number of topics.

## Benefits

1. **More Comprehensive View**: Users can now see their performance across more topics in a single visualization
2. **Better Topic Coverage**: The chart now captures a larger portion of the user's topic performance data
3. **Enhanced Information Density**: More information is displayed without sacrificing readability

## Testing

The changes were tested with users having a variety of topic performance profiles, including:
- Users with many topics (>20)
- Users with high topic variation in accuracy 
- Users with low attempt counts across topics

The chart consistently displays the top 16 most attempted topics with appropriate visual representation of accuracy and attempt counts.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- User option to toggle between viewing by most attempted vs. highest accuracy
- Filtering options to focus on specific topic categories
- Interactive tooltips with more detailed performance metrics
