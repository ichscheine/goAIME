# Wind Rose Chart Color Enhancement

## Overview
We've enhanced the wind rose chart in the goAIME progress tracking dashboard by increasing the performance color granularity from 3 to 5 levels. This provides students with a more detailed visual representation of their topic performance.

## Changes Made

### Previous Color Scheme (3 levels)
- **High Performance (75-100%)**: Green (#10b981)
- **Medium Performance (50-75%)**: Orange/Yellow (#f59e0b)
- **Low Performance (0-50%)**: Red (#ef4444)

### New Enhanced Color Scheme (5 levels)
- **Exceptional (90-100%)**: Dark Green (#059669)
- **High (75-89%)**: Green (#10b981)
- **Above Average (60-74%)**: Light Green (#a3e635)
- **Medium (40-59%)**: Orange (#f59e0b)
- **Low (0-39%)**: Red (#ef4444)

## Benefits

1. **More Detailed Performance Insights**: Students can now distinguish between truly exceptional topics (90%+ accuracy) and those that are good but have room for improvement (75-89%).

2. **Better Learning Prioritization**: The added granularity helps students better prioritize their study efforts:
   - Topics in dark green (90%+) may require only occasional review
   - Topics in green (75-89%) are strong but could be improved
   - Topics in light green (60-74%) show competence but need more practice
   - Topics in orange (40-59%) need focused attention
   - Topics in red (<40%) require significant remediation

3. **Improved Motivation**: The additional performance tiers create more achievable intermediate goals. Rather than a large jump from "medium" to "high" performance, students can now aim for the "above average" tier first.

4. **Enhanced Visual Experience**: The expanded color palette makes the chart more visually engaging and information-rich.

## Implementation Notes

The implementation includes:
1. Updated color assignment logic in the wind rose segment creation
2. Revised legend with 5 performance tiers instead of 3
3. Adjusted thresholds to create balanced performance tiers:
   - Exceptional: â‰¥90%
   - High: 75-89%
   - Above Average: 60-74%
   - Medium: 40-59%
   - Low: <40%

## Verification

A verification script (`verify_enhanced_color_scheme.js`) was created to test the color assignment logic across various accuracy levels, confirming that:
- Topics with 95% accuracy receive the exceptional (dark green) color
- Topics with 81% accuracy receive the high (green) color
- Topics with 67% accuracy receive the above average (light green) color
- Topics with 55% accuracy receive the medium (orange) color
- Topics with 32% accuracy receive the low (red) color
