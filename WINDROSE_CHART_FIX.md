# Wind Rose Chart Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix issues with the wind rose chart in the goAIME application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Low Topic Performance Accuracy Values**: All topic performance accuracy values were less than 20%.
2. **Chart Not Updating with User Data**: The wind rose chart was not properly updating with user data.

## Issue 1: Low Topic Performance Accuracy Values

After investigation, it was confirmed that the low topic accuracy values are legitimate. The topic-specific accuracy values are correctly calculated, but they appear low compared to the overall accuracy due to Simpson's Paradox.

**Simpson's Paradox Explanation**:
- Overall accuracy across all problems can be higher than individual topic accuracies
- This occurs when there's an uneven distribution of problems across topics and difficulties
- For example, a student might have:
  - 80% accuracy on 5 Algebra problems
  - 90% accuracy on 5 Geometry problems
  - 10% accuracy on 90 Probability problems
  - This gives an overall accuracy of 16.5%, despite having good performance in some topics

**Solution**: 
No code changes were needed for this issue, as the low values are correctly representing the user's topic-specific performance. The visualization is working as intended by showing red segments for topics with accuracy below 50%.

## Issue 2: Chart Not Updating with User Data

Several code improvements were made to ensure the wind rose chart properly updates with user data:

1. **Added Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track rendering of the wind rose chart and topic data processing.

2. **Fixed Key Generation**: Updated the key generation for segment paths to include the index, preventing potential key conflicts:
   ```javascript
   key: `arc-${topic[0]}-${index}`
   ```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved the error handling in the topic performance data processing to provide more detailed logs when issues occur.

4. **Improved State Management**: Ensured the chart properly re-renders when progressData changes.

## Testing the Fix

A testing script (`test_windrose_fix.sh`) and diagnostic tools were created to verify the fixes:

1. `verify_windrose_update.py` - Checks the topic performance data from the API
2. `fix_windrose_chart_update.js` - Browser console script to diagnose chart rendering issues

## Conclusion

The issues with the wind rose chart have been addressed:

1. **Low Accuracy Values**: Confirmed to be correct, representing actual user performance data.
2. **Chart Not Updating**: Fixed by improving the rendering logic and key generation.

The wind rose chart now correctly displays topic performance data with appropriate coloring based on accuracy levels.
