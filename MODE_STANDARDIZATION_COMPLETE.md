# Mode Standardization Update

## Summary
On May 28, 2025, we standardized the session mode terminology in goAIME to use "competition" instead of "contest" consistently throughout the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Update**:
   - Updated all existing sessions in the database with `mode='contest'` to use `mode='competition'`
   - 3 sessions were updated during this process

2. **Frontend Update**:
   - Updated all references in App.js from `contest` to `competition`
   - Updated UI terminology for consistency

## Rationale
This standardization was done to ensure consistency across the application. Previously, the application used both "contest" and "competition" interchangeably, which could lead to confusion and potential bugs.

## Technical Notes
- The mode standardization was implemented using a dedicated script: `standardize_session_modes.py`
- No schema changes were required, only data value updates
- All updates were logged in the application event log

## Future Considerations
- Ensure all new sessions are created with the standardized "competition" mode
- Update any documentation or help materials to reflect the standardized terminology
